# FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that I have built to fulfill the requirements for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Each project demonstrates various JavaScript concepts and algorithms, showcasing my ability to write efficient and clean code.

## Projects Included:

**1. A Palindrome Checker**

- A web application that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
- Utilizes JavaScript string methods and regular expressions to validate input.
  
**2. A Roman Numerical Converter**

- A tool that converts Arabic numbers to Roman numerals and vice versa.
- Implements algorithms to handle edge cases and ensure accurate conversions.

**3. Telephone Number Validator**

- A validator for phone numbers that checks for various formats and returns whether they are valid.
- Employs regular expressions to validate user input.

**4. Cash Register**

- A simulation of a cash register that calculates change due and returns the correct denominations.
- Implements logic to manage cash-in-drawer (CID) and calculate change accurately.

**5. Pokémon Search App**

- An interactive application that allows users to search for Pokémon by name or ID.
- Fetches data from the PokéAPI and displays information such as stats, types, and images.

## Certification Objective:
The JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification from FreeCodeCamp is designed to teach developers how to effectively utilize JavaScript to solve algorithmic challenges and manage data structures. It emphasizes core concepts such as:

- Basic JavaScript syntax and operations
- DOM Javascript
- Functional programming

Each project in this repository follows the guidelines provided in the certification course and aims to pass all the user stories required for the respective projects.

## How to Use:
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imanmaulana1/freecodecamp-javascript-algorithms.git
```
- Navigate to each project folder.
- Run **index.html** in your browser.
